# -Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

Currently, Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.


Data Description

The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

Attribute Information:

Hour:

There must be high demand during the office timings around 8 A.M. and 8 P.M., also for early morning and late evening we are having a relatably different trends. And, definately low demand between 8 A.M. and 8 P.M.

Temperature:

In general, temperature has negative correlation with the bike demands. So, as the temperature increases, the bike count also increases.

Humidity:

Humidity acts as a deterrent to a bike ride. The bike count decreases when the humidity increases.

Wind Speed:

Due to Wind speed , there is certain increase in the bike count but the change is very small.

Visibility:

If there is low visibility, people won't prefer to ride the bike. So,as the visibility increases , the number of bike count also increases.
Rainfall and Snowfall:
If there is rainfall/Snowfall, people don't prefer to travel out. And, hence the bike count decreases.

Steps:

•	Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Data Summary
•	Hypothesis
•	Model Building
•	Evaluation

Conclusion:

________________________________________
When we compare the root mean squared error and mean absolute error of all the models, the XGBoost model has less root mean squared error and mean absolute error, ending with the accuracy of 94% . So, finally this model is best for predicting the bike rental count on daily basis.As we can see the total amount of bike rentals increases with the temperature per month. Whereas it seems that the rentals are independent of the wind speed and the humidity, because they are almost constant over the months. This also confirms on the one hand the high correlation between rentals and temperature and on the other hand that nice weather could be a good predictor.So people mainly rent bikes on nice days and nice temperature. This could be important of planning new bike rental stations.
